# StrongDM Manager - Development Progress

## Project Overview
A comprehensive StrongDM resource management application with GUI interface for creating and managing resources via the StrongDM API.

## Progress Timeline

### Initial Development
- ✅ Created Python GUI application using tkinter/ttk
- ✅ Implemented StrongDM API integration with Python SDK
- ✅ Added support for SSH, RDP, and Database resource types
- ✅ Built CSV bulk import functionality
- ✅ Created debug tab with API testing tools

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- ✅ Fixed geometry manager mixing error (pack/grid coordination)
- ✅ Resolved API credential persistence issues
- ✅ Added comprehensive resource subtype support:
  - SSH: Password, Public Key, Certificate Based, Customer Managed Key
  - RDP: Basic Authentication, Certificate Based
  - Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Redis
- ✅ Implemented dynamic tag loading from live tenant data
- ✅ Added real-time API call logging and debugging

### Recent Fixes (2025-09-11)
- ✅ **Tag Format Fix**: Changed from `type:data` to `type=data` format to match actual StrongDM GUI
- ✅ **Button Visibility Fix**: Resolved issue where "Clear Form" and "Create Resource" buttons disappeared when selecting resource subtypes
- ✅ **Debug UI Enhancement**: Implemented scrollable debug tab with 3-column grid layout for better button organization

## Current Status
All core functionality working correctly with live StrongDM tenant:
- Connection: ✅ Connected to tenant with 5 resources
- Tag Parsing: ✅ Correctly parsing `type=postgres`, `type=ssh`, `type=windows` tags
- UI: ✅ All buttons and forms working properly
- API Integration: ✅ Real-time logging and debugging functional
